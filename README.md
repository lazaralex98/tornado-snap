This is a MetaMask Snap POC with an accompanying Next.js dapp that displays how to **store state within MetaMask Flask**. It also has a currently unfinished function to retrieve extended keys from the MetaMask wallet.

# Getting Started

Setup the modules with:

```shell
yarn
```

Run this to build and serve the snap at https://localhost:8000

```bash
yarn build:snap && yarn start:snap
```

Then, run the Next development server:

```bash
yarn start:next
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the dapp, install the snap and interact with it.
